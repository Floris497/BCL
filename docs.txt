Sockets:

How to build a socket command:

all commands have the same start of 3 bytes, the structure is shown below:

Common:
  [00-01] sensor/acurator code (always 2 bytes/chars like: "CP" for compas)
  [02]    (r|a|i) request|answer|instruction (requests are used to get snesor data, and are answerd with an answer)

Request:
   compass:'CP' [03-03]
     speed:'SP' [03-03]
  distance:'DT' [03-06]
        [03-06] direction to measure "-180" to "+180"

Answer: numbers are send in human readable chars (send "0600" for 600)
   compass:'CP' [03-06]
        [03-06] degrees form north (0 = no compass availible)
     speed:'SP' [03-06]
        [03-06]  speed in 0-1024 (0 = no speed availible)
  distance:'DT' [03-10]
        [03-06] 0 to 9999 cm (0 = no distance availible)
        [07-10] -180 to +180 direction of mesearment (send "-180" for -180ยบ and "+180" for 180ยบ)

Instruction: instructions are most of the time send from the client to the robot, for movement.
    drive:'DR'
        [03-07] left speed "-1024" to "+1024"
        [08-12] left speed "-1024" to "+1024"
     stop:'ST' (does not need more than 3 bytes)
